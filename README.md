Analyze. Detect. Protect. — in real time.  
A multimodal AI threat detection platform for text, audio, and image inputs — delivering live insights, without compromising your privacy.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

  
Multimodal threat detection system that streams audio, text, and images and uses Groq to analyze threats.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Modern threats can originate from text messages, speech, or visual content.  
**ThreatShield** empowers users to detect hidden dangers across all three modalities using **Groq-powered real-time AI** — delivering actionable threat summaries, severity scores, and trend graphs, all securely inside the browser.

Applications include:
- Schools & universities (bullying/fighting alerts)
- Online platforms & social media (toxic speech, harassment)
- Defense and law enforcement (weapon detection, intrusion detection)
- Any organization needing real-time threat monitoring with local privacy.

**Our Approach:**


We chose the Multimodal Threat Detection problem because in today’s world, threats are no longer limited to written text — they emerge through speech, visuals, and even casual communication.
However, most existing solutions are either siloed (handling only one input type), slow to respond, or heavily reliant on cloud processing, risking user privacy.

Our goal was to build a system that is:

✅ Multimodal — analyzing text, audio, and images together,

✅ Real-time — detecting threats instantly with Groq’s high-speed inference,

✅ Privacy-first — processing all data locally without server dependency,

✅ Actionable — giving clear summaries, sentiment scores, and live safety graphs.

We believe ThreatGuard represents the next generation of proactive threat monitoring — fast, secure, visual, and adaptable for education, law enforcement, enterprises, and online communities.


## 🏆 Breakthroughs

- 🔄 **Unified analysis pipeline** for text and audio.
- 🕒📈 **Timestamped threat plotting** with severity graph.
